# Hello!

This is my side project Checket.
You can add it to your server [here.](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=888736693128151103&permissions=2147534848&scope=applications.commands%20bot) Though it is still a work in progress.

What it does currently is it screenshots any link you give it and sends it back to you. This can be useful for checking sketchy links and avoiding rickrolls.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# make .env file
$ nano .env

# add your own discordbot token
TOKEN=ODM2NTY3NTQxNzIzMDM5Nw==.sWy0mN.PZW22eJet613hba4zOFcWBgkb3n #example token. Ofc it's not real.

# start project with node
$ node index.js

```
